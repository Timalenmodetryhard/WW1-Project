            <h2>Corn Flowers</h2>
            <p>In the United Kingdom, the poppy is closely linked to the First World War, symbolizing the memory of the sacrifices made by British and Commonwealth soldiers. This profound connection originates from the devastated battlefields of the war, where delicate blue flowers began to bloom amidst the ravages of violence. Inspired by these fragile blooms, poets like John McCrae invoked their symbolism in famous works such as "In Flanders Fields," thereby strengthening the association of the poppy with remembrance and commemoration. Since then, the poppy has become a symbol of respect and gratitude towards those who served and fell during the war. Each year, on Remembrance Day, the poppy is proudly worn by millions of people across the United Kingdom, recalling the sacrifices and heroism of First World War soldiers, thus perpetuating their memory for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Poppy</h2>
            <p>The poppy has become an iconic symbol of remembrance for the First World War in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth nations. Its association with the conflict dates back to the poem "In Flanders Fields" by Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, which depicts red poppies growing on the battlefields of Flanders. This poem captured the public imagination and transformed the poppy into a universal symbol of remembrance and commemoration for the sacrifices of soldiers. In the UK, the poppy is worn on Remembrance Day, November 11th, to honor the millions who lost their lives during the war and to support veterans and their families. Thus, the poppy has become a poignant reminder of the bravery and resilience of First World War soldiers, as well as the importance of never forgetting their sacrifice.</p>
