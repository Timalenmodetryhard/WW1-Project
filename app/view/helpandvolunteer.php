        <h3>Help Wanted</h3>
        <p>
            As a non-profit organisation we are always looking for unpaid Volunteers of any age and skill level.<br>
            It's all team work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are looking for people to help with the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Guides</li>
                <li>Cleaners</li>
                <li>Reception</li>
                <li>Security</li>

            <strong>1. Guides<br></strong>
            <p>The Guides take our visitors on tours around the Gallery and tell them many unusual stories from WW1.<br>
                No knowledge necessary, we teach you the stories and what to say. Some guides learn them all, some learn a few and work with other guides to show visitors around. Taking visitors around can usually take an hour (longest ever was 4 hours !!)<br>

            <strong>2. Cleaners<br></strong>
            <p>The Cleaners have plenty to do!<br>
                I'm afraid it's a bit like painting the Forth Rail Bridge - never ending!!<br>
                Dusting, polishing, hoovering, etc. Keeping the building inside and carpark outside as clean of any rubbish and tidy and presentable as possible.

            <strong>3. Security & reception<br></strong>
            <p>
                Reception and Security is another very important job.<br>
                They are the frontline, the first people that visitors see. They must be friendly and helpful to meet and greet visitors. Tell visitors about the set up and arrange to pass the visitor on to one of the Guides. They also take monies from any sale of items in our shop. Some Volunteers do one or more of the above roles depending how busy we are.<br>
                Volunteering with us is an interesting and fun way to spend your spare time, meet others to form a great team, help in a useful project.<br>
